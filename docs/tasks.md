## üêõ Bug Reports

### Bug #001: Authentication System Not Using Convex Auth ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Users cannot sign up or sign in

**Description:**
The authentication system was using a custom implementation that bypassed Convex Auth's built-in functionality. This caused the error "User with this email already exists" when trying to sign up, and prevented proper authentication flow.

**Error Details:**
```
[CONVEX M(auth:signUp)] [Request ID: 2f30d59cc648c35a] Server Error
Uncaught Error: User with this email already exists
at handler (../convex/auth.ts:56:13)
```

**Root Cause:**
1. `ConvexProvider` was not using `ConvexAuthNextjsProvider`
2. Custom `signUp` mutation tried to create users directly in database
3. Convex Auth's built-in user management was not being utilized
4. Authentication flow was not properly integrated

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated `ConvexProvider` to use `ConvexAuthNextjsProvider`
2. ‚úÖ Replaced custom `signUp` and `signIn` mutations with Convex Auth's Password provider
3. ‚úÖ Updated `createOrUpdateUser` to work with Convex Auth identity
4. ‚úÖ Updated frontend forms to use Convex Auth hooks (`useAuthActions`)
5. ‚úÖ Created HTTP router configuration for auth routes
6. ‚úÖ Set SITE_URL environment variable for Convex Auth
7. ‚úÖ Installed required Convex Auth packages
8. ‚úÖ Added `ConvexAuthNextjsServerProvider` to root layout for server-side authentication support

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/providers/ConvexProvider.tsx` - Updated to use ConvexAuthNextjsProvider
- `convex/auth.ts` - Completely rewritten to use Convex Auth's Password provider
- `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx` - Updated to use useAuthActions hook
- `src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx` - Updated to use useAuthActions hook
- `src/components/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` - Updated to work with Convex Auth

### Bug #002: Missing Auth Database Schema & Middleware Placement ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** Critical
**Impact:** Authentication completely non-functional despite proper setup

**Description:**
Multiple interconnected issues prevented authentication from working:
1. Middleware placement issue (root vs src directory)
2. Missing required database schema for Convex Auth tables

**Error Details:**
```
POST /api/auth 404 in 3431ms
Hit error while running `auth:signIn`:
Index authAccounts.providerAndAccountId not found
‚úì Compiled middleware in 2ms
```

**Root Cause:**
1. **File Placement**: `middleware.ts` in root directory instead of `src/middleware.ts` (required for Next.js App Router + src structure)
2. **Missing Database Schema**: `convex/schema.ts` was missing required `authTables` import and auth table definitions
3. **Schema Mismatch**: Custom users table didn't match Convex Auth expectations

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX**: Moved middleware from root to `src/middleware.ts` 
2. ‚úÖ **DATABASE FIX**: Added `import { authTables } from '@convex-dev/auth/server'` to schema
3. ‚úÖ **SCHEMA UPDATE**: Spread `...authTables` into schema definition to include all required auth tables
4. ‚úÖ **USERS TABLE**: Updated users table to extend Convex Auth base schema with optional fields
5. ‚úÖ **INDEX FIX**: Changed email index from 'by_email' to 'email' to match Convex Auth expectations

**Files Modified:**
- `src/middleware.ts` - Moved from root directory with convexAuthNextjsMiddleware configuration
- `convex/schema.ts` - Added authTables import and spread, updated users table schema

**Database Tables Added:**
- `authAccounts` - User authentication accounts per provider
- `authSessions` - Active user sessions  
- `authRefreshTokens` - JWT refresh token management
- `authVerificationCodes` - OTP/magic link tokens
- `authVerifiers` - PKCE verifiers for OAuth
- `authRateLimits` - Rate limiting for authentication attempts

**Testing Status:** ‚úÖ Authentication fully functional - all endpoints responding correctly
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2 hours (Completed)

### Bug #003: Missing JWT_PRIVATE_KEY Environment Variable ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** Critical
**Impact:** Authentication completely fails during sign-up/sign-in with JWT token generation errors

**Description:**
Users attempting to sign up or sign in encountered "Missing environment variable 'JWT_PRIVATE_KEY'" errors. This critical environment variable is required by Convex Auth for JWT token generation but was not documented in setup instructions.

**Error Details:**
```
[Request ID: bc69853953e6a4c1] Server Error
Uncaught Error: Missing environment variable 'JWT_PRIVATE_KEY'
at requireEnv (../../node_modules/@convex-dev/auth/src/server/utils.ts:5:9)
at generateToken (../../node_modules/@convex-dev/auth/src/server/implementation/tokens.ts:19:19)
```

**Root Cause:**
1. **Missing Environment Variable**: `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` was not set in Convex deployment
2. **Documentation Gap**: Setup instructions didn't include required Convex Auth environment variables
3. **Incomplete Setup**: Only `SITE_URL` was configured, but `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` was missing

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ **Official CLI Setup**: Used `npx @convex-dev/auth` to properly configure all authentication keys
2. ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Generated proper RSA `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWKS` keys
3. ‚úÖ **Documentation Update**: Added Convex environment variables section to README.md
4. ‚úÖ **Setup Instructions**: Updated docs/tasks.md with official CLI setup process
5. ‚úÖ **Warning Added**: Included critical warnings about authentication failure without these variables

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` - RSA private key for JWT token generation and signing
- `JWKS` - JSON Web Key Set for public key verification  
- `SITE_URL` - For authentication redirects and callbacks

**Files Modified:**
- **Convex Deployment**: Added `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `JWKS`, and `SITE_URL` environment variables
- **convex/auth.config.ts**: Created by CLI for auth configuration
- **README.md**: Added Step 3b with official CLI setup process
- **docs/tasks.md**: Updated Environment Variables section with CLI-first approach

**Commands for Setup:**
```bash
# Recommended: Use official CLI
npx @convex-dev/auth

# Alternative: Manual setup
npx convex env set JWT_PRIVATE_KEY "secure-random-key"
npx convex env set SITE_URL "http://localhost:3000"
```

**Testing Status:** ‚úÖ Authentication now fully functional - sign-up and sign-in working correctly
**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes (Completed)

## Development Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Node.js 18+** with npm or pnpm
- **Git** for version control
- **VS Code** with TypeScript and Tailwind extensions (recommended)
- **Modern browser** for testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Required Accounts & Services
- **Convex Account** - Create at convex.dev
- **Vercel Account** - For deployment (optional initially)
- **GitHub Account** - For repository hosting

### Development Environment Setup
1. Clone/create repository
2. Install Convex CLI: `npm install -g convex`
3. Set up development environment variables
4. Install project dependencies
5. Verify development server functionality

**Development Workflow**: Use two terminal windows:
- Terminal 1: `npx convex dev` (backend)
- Terminal 2: `npm run dev` (frontend)

Both servers must be running for authentication and database functionality.

### Environment Variables (Development)

**Next.js Environment Variables (.env.local):**
```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:your-deployment-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
# Additional variables will be added as features are implemented
```

**Required Convex Environment Variables:**
These must be set using the official Convex Auth CLI (recommended):

```bash
# Run the Convex Auth CLI to set up all required environment variables
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

This automatically configures:
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` - RSA private key for JWT token generation and signing
- `JWKS` - JSON Web Key Set for public key verification
- `SITE_URL` - For authentication redirects and callbacks
- `convex/auth.config.ts` - Auth configuration file

**Alternative Manual Setup** (if CLI doesn't work):
```bash
# Required for JWT token generation (use a secure random string)
npx convex env set JWT_PRIVATE_KEY "your-secure-random-key-here"

# Required for authentication redirects  
npx convex env set SITE_URL "http://localhost:3000"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Without `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, authentication will fail with "Missing environment variable" errors.

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Technical Risks
**Novel.sh Complexity:** Custom block development may be more complex than expected
- *Mitigation:* Start with simple text blocks, add interactivity incrementally
- *Contingency:* Fall back to simpler editor with separate task management

**Convex Scaling:** Real-time collaboration may hit performance limits
- *Mitigation:* Test with multiple concurrent users early
- *Contingency:* Implement selective real-time updates or polling fallback

**Mobile Performance:** Complex document blocks may not work well on mobile
- *Mitigation:* Design mobile-first, test on real devices frequently
- *Contingency:* Simplified mobile UI with full features on desktop only

### Development Risks
**Feature Scope Creep:** Temptation to add features beyond Phase 1 scope
- *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to Phase 1 feature list
- *Contingency:* Move additional features to Phase 2 backlog

**Authentication Complexity:** Role-based permissions may become overly complex
- *Mitigation:* Start with simple roles, add granularity incrementally
- *Contingency:* Simplify initial role model, enhance in Phase 2

## Development Guidelines

### Foundation-First Approach
**Start with Features 1-5 before moving to any complex features. This ensures:**
- Authentication and permissions work correctly
- Role-based routing is secure
- Dashboard foundation is solid
- All core infrastructure is validated

### Phase 1 vs Phase 2
**Phase 1:** Focus on project management core (Features 1-16)
- All projects are `project_brief` document type
- Single navigation structure
- Core functionality fully operational

**Phase 2:** Document type system and mode switching (Features 17-18)
- Multiple document types and templates
- Mode switcher between Projects and Documentation
- Advanced cross-document features

### Testing Strategy
- Test role-based permissions thoroughly for each feature
- Use real-time collaboration testing with multiple browser instances  
- Test mobile responsiveness throughout development
- Implement E2E tests for critical user flows

### Performance Considerations
- Progressive loading for large documents
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Real-time update optimization
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Security Priorities
- Role-based access control at API level
- Data isolation between clients
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication implementation
