## üìã Feature 17.2 Series Roadmap

### Section Refinement Order (Admin Config First):
1. **Feature 17.2.1:** Inbox Section Deep Dive ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
2. **Feature 17.2.2:** My Work Section Deep Dive ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
3. **Feature 17.2.7:** Client Admin Config Deep Dive ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
4. **Feature 17.2.8:** User Admin Config Deep Dive üéØ **IN PROGRESS**
5. **Feature 17.2.9:** Settings Admin Config Deep Dive ‚è≠Ô∏è **NEXT**
6. **Feature 17.2.3:** Projects Section Deep Dive
7. **Feature 17.2.4:** Sprints Section Deep Dive  
8. **Feature 17.2.5:** Team Section Deep Dive
9. **Feature 17.2.6:** Client View Section Deep Dive

## üöÄ Major Features (Post-Admin Config)

### Feature 18: Universal Attachment System  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature 17.2 (Admin UX Complete) ‚úÖ **COMPLETE ALL 17.X FIRST**  
**Goal:** Implement a comprehensive attachment system that supports media, documents, and files across all entities (projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments) with library aggregation capabilities.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to attach images, documents, and files to any content (projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments) so that I can provide visual context, reference materials, and supporting documentation. As a team lead, I want to view all attachments in a library view so that I can manage project assets centrally.

#### Core Architecture (Following Existing Patterns)
**Polymorphic Attachment Model** (Following comments.ts pattern):
- Single `attachments` table with polymorphic relationships
- Supports: projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments
- Future-proof for new entities
- Client/department scoping for permissions
- Library aggregation via `isPublic` flag

#### Implementation Components
1. **File Upload System**: Drag-and-drop upload zones for all supported entities
2. **Attachment Display Components**: Image preview, document icons, library grid view
3. **Polymorphic Query System**: Dynamic queries based on entity type
4. **Upload & Management Mutations**: Complete CRUD operations for attachments

### Feature 19: Enhanced Document Comments: Live Team Collaboration Feature
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 20-24 hours

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate through live message threads within documents so that I can have natural conversations, track feedback, and automatically extract actionable tasks from our discussions.

#### Core Concept:
- Keep existing Convex comment infrastructure - this is a UI/UX transformation, not a rebuild

- Maintain document anchoring - comments can still reference specific elements/sections
- Enable AI-assisted task extraction - analyze conversations for actionable items

- Users can manage account preferences (theme, notifications)
- All changes are validated and securely processed
