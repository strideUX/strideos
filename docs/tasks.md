## 🐛 Bug Reports

### Bug #001: Authentication System Not Using Convex Auth ✅ FIXED
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Users cannot sign up or sign in

**Description:**
The authentication system was using a custom implementation that bypassed Convex Auth's built-in functionality. This caused the error "User with this email already exists" when trying to sign up, and prevented proper authentication flow.

**Error Details:**
```
[CONVEX M(auth:signUp)] [Request ID: 2f30d59cc648c35a] Server Error
Uncaught Error: User with this email already exists
at handler (../convex/auth.ts:56:13)
```

**Root Cause:**
1. `ConvexProvider` was not using `ConvexAuthNextjsProvider`
2. Custom `signUp` mutation tried to create users directly in database
3. Convex Auth's built-in user management was not being utilized
4. Authentication flow was not properly integrated

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ Updated `ConvexProvider` to use `ConvexAuthNextjsProvider`
2. ✅ Replaced custom `signUp` and `signIn` mutations with Convex Auth's Password provider
3. ✅ Updated `createOrUpdateUser` to work with Convex Auth identity
4. ✅ Updated frontend forms to use Convex Auth hooks (`useAuthActions`)
5. ✅ Created HTTP router configuration for auth routes
6. ✅ Set SITE_URL environment variable for Convex Auth
7. ✅ Installed required Convex Auth packages
8. ✅ Added `ConvexAuthNextjsServerProvider` to root layout for server-side authentication support

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/providers/ConvexProvider.tsx` - Updated to use ConvexAuthNextjsProvider
- `convex/auth.ts` - Completely rewritten to use Convex Auth's Password provider
- `src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx` - Updated to use useAuthActions hook
- `src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx` - Updated to use useAuthActions hook
- `src/components/providers/AuthProvider.tsx` - Updated to work with Convex Auth
- `src/app/(auth)/sign-out/page.tsx` - Updated to use useAuthActions hook
- `convex/http.ts` - Created HTTP router configuration
- `package.json` - Added @convex-dev/auth and @auth/core dependencies
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added ConvexAuthNextjsServerProvider for server-side auth support

**Testing Status:** Ready for testing
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours (Completed)

### Bug #002: Missing Auth Database Schema & Middleware Placement ✅ FIXED
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** Critical
**Impact:** Authentication completely non-functional despite proper setup

**Description:**
Multiple interconnected issues prevented authentication from working:
1. Middleware placement issue (root vs src directory)
2. Missing required database schema for Convex Auth tables

**Error Details:**
```
POST /api/auth 404 in 3431ms
Hit error while running `auth:signIn`:
Index authAccounts.providerAndAccountId not found
✓ Compiled middleware in 2ms
```

**Root Cause:**
1. **File Placement**: `middleware.ts` in root directory instead of `src/middleware.ts` (required for Next.js App Router + src structure)
2. **Missing Database Schema**: `convex/schema.ts` was missing required `authTables` import and auth table definitions
3. **Schema Mismatch**: Custom users table didn't match Convex Auth expectations

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ✅ **CRITICAL FIX**: Moved middleware from root to `src/middleware.ts` 
2. ✅ **DATABASE FIX**: Added `import { authTables } from '@convex-dev/auth/server'` to schema
3. ✅ **SCHEMA UPDATE**: Spread `...authTables` into schema definition to include all required auth tables
4. ✅ **USERS TABLE**: Updated users table to extend Convex Auth base schema with optional fields
5. ✅ **INDEX FIX**: Changed email index from 'by_email' to 'email' to match Convex Auth expectations

**Files Modified:**
- `src/middleware.ts` - Moved from root directory with convexAuthNextjsMiddleware configuration
- `convex/schema.ts` - Added authTables import and spread, updated users table schema

**Database Tables Added:**
- `authAccounts` - User authentication accounts per provider
- `authSessions` - Active user sessions  
- `authRefreshTokens` - JWT refresh token management
- `authVerificationCodes` - OTP/magic link tokens
- `authVerifiers` - PKCE verifiers for OAuth
- `authRateLimits` - Rate limiting for authentication attempts

**Testing Status:** ✅ Authentication fully functional - all endpoints responding correctly
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2 hours (Completed)

### Bug #003: Missing JWT_PRIVATE_KEY Environment Variable ✅ FIXED
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** Critical
**Impact:** Authentication completely fails during sign-up/sign-in with JWT token generation errors

**Description:**
Users attempting to sign up or sign in encountered "Missing environment variable 'JWT_PRIVATE_KEY'" errors. This critical environment variable is required by Convex Auth for JWT token generation but was not documented in setup instructions.

**Error Details:**
```
[Request ID: bc69853953e6a4c1] Server Error
Uncaught Error: Missing environment variable 'JWT_PRIVATE_KEY'
at requireEnv (../../node_modules/@convex-dev/auth/src/server/utils.ts:5:9)
at generateToken (../../node_modules/@convex-dev/auth/src/server/implementation/tokens.ts:19:19)
```

**Root Cause:**
1. **Missing Environment Variable**: `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` was not set in Convex deployment
2. **Documentation Gap**: Setup instructions didn't include required Convex Auth environment variables
3. **Incomplete Setup**: Only `SITE_URL` was configured, but `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` was missing

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ **Official CLI Setup**: Used `npx @convex-dev/auth` to properly configure all authentication keys
2. ✅ **Environment Variables**: Generated proper RSA `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWKS` keys
3. ✅ **Documentation Update**: Added Convex environment variables section to README.md
4. ✅ **Setup Instructions**: Updated docs/tasks.md with official CLI setup process
5. ✅ **Warning Added**: Included critical warnings about authentication failure without these variables

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` - RSA private key for JWT token generation and signing
- `JWKS` - JSON Web Key Set for public key verification  
- `SITE_URL` - For authentication redirects and callbacks

**Files Modified:**
- **Convex Deployment**: Added `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `JWKS`, and `SITE_URL` environment variables
- **convex/auth.config.ts**: Created by CLI for auth configuration
- **README.md**: Added Step 3b with official CLI setup process
- **docs/tasks.md**: Updated Environment Variables section with CLI-first approach

**Commands for Setup:**
```bash
# Recommended: Use official CLI
npx @convex-dev/auth

# Alternative: Manual setup
npx convex env set JWT_PRIVATE_KEY "secure-random-key"
npx convex env set SITE_URL "http://localhost:3000"
```

**Testing Status:** ✅ Authentication now fully functional - sign-up and sign-in working correctly
**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes (Completed)

### Bug #004: Duplicate Route Conflict - Parallel Pages Error ✅ FIXED
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Next.js runtime error preventing application from loading

**Description:**
After implementing Enhancement 3.1 (Auth Flow Optimization), the application failed to load due to duplicate route conflicts. Both the old `(auth)` route group and new root-level auth pages were resolving to the same paths, causing Next.js parallel pages errors.

**Error Details:**
```
Runtime Error
/src/app/sign-out
You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. Please check /(auth)/sign-out and /sign-out.
```

**Root Cause:**
1. **Incomplete Migration**: During Enhancement 3.1, we created new root-level auth pages but failed to remove the old `(auth)` route group
2. **Duplicate Routes**: Both route structures existed simultaneously:
   - `src/app/(auth)/sign-out/page.tsx` AND `src/app/sign-out/page.tsx` → both resolve to `/sign-out`
   - `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx` AND `src/app/sign-up/page.tsx` → both resolve to `/sign-up`
3. **Next.js Conflict**: Next.js cannot handle two pages resolving to the same route

**Solution Applied:**
1. ✅ **Removed Entire (auth) Route Group**: Deleted `src/app/(auth)/` directory completely
2. ✅ **Kept Root-Level Auth Pages**: Maintained new structure with auth pages at app root level
3. ✅ **Verified No Broken Imports**: Confirmed all imports reference `@/components/auth/` components, not route paths
4. ✅ **Tested Route Resolution**: Verified all auth routes work correctly

**Current Clean Route Structure:**
- `/` → Sign-in form (root page)
- `/sign-out` → Sign-out page (root level)
- `/dashboard` → Authenticated landing page

**Files Removed:**
- **src/app/(auth)/** - Entire directory deleted to resolve conflicts
  - Removed: `(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`
  - Removed: `(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`
  - Removed: `(auth)/sign-out/page.tsx`

**Files Kept:**
- **src/app/page.tsx** - Root sign-in functionality
- **src/app/sign-out/page.tsx** - Root-level sign-out page
- **src/app/dashboard/page.tsx** - Dashboard landing page

**Testing Status:** ✅ All routes working correctly, no more duplicate route errors
**Estimated Fix Time:** 10 minutes (Completed)

**Progress:** 100% complete
**Priority:** Low (Code Quality)

**Goal:** Remove all Clerk remnants from the project since we're fully committed to Convex Auth, eliminating potential conflicts and confusion.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all unused authentication system files removed so that the codebase is clean and there's no confusion about which auth system is being used.

**Changes Applied:**
- [x] Deleted `.env.example` file (contained outdated Clerk references)
- [x] Deleted `.clerk/` hidden directory from project root
- [x] Removed Clerk references from `.gitignore`
- [x] Regenerated `package-lock.json` to clean up dependencies
- [x] Fixed `@auth/core` version conflict (downgraded to 0.37.0 for Convex Auth compatibility)
- [x] Verified authentication still works with Convex Auth

**Current Clean State:**
- ✅ No `.env.example` file
- ✅ No `.clerk/` directory
- ✅ No Clerk references in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Clean `package-lock.json` regenerated
- ✅ Authentication working with Convex Auth only

**Files Removed:**
- **`.env.example`** - Contained outdated Clerk environment variable examples
- **`.clerk/`** - Hidden directory with Clerk configuration files

**Files Modified:**
- **`.gitignore`** - Removed Clerk-specific ignore patterns

- `@auth/core` was downgraded from 0.40.0 to 0.37.0 for Convex Auth compatibility

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner codebase without unused auth system files
- No confusion about which authentication system is active
- Eliminated potential version conflicts
- Reduced project bloat

**Testing Status:** ✅ Authentication working correctly with Convex Auth, no Clerk dependencies in use

- Terminal 1: `npx convex dev` (backend)
- Terminal 2: `npm run dev` (frontend)

Both servers must be running for authentication and database functionality.

### Environment Variables (Development)

**Next.js Environment Variables (.env.local):**
```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:your-deployment-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
# Additional variables will be added as features are implemented
```

**Required Convex Environment Variables:**
These must be set using the official Convex Auth CLI (recommended):

```bash
# Run the Convex Auth CLI to set up all required environment variables
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

This automatically configures:
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` - RSA private key for JWT token generation and signing
- `JWKS` - JSON Web Key Set for public key verification
- `SITE_URL` - For authentication redirects and callbacks
- `convex/auth.config.ts` - Auth configuration file

**Alternative Manual Setup** (if CLI doesn't work):
```bash
# Required for JWT token generation (use a secure random string)
npx convex env set JWT_PRIVATE_KEY "your-secure-random-key-here"

# Required for authentication redirects  
npx convex env set SITE_URL "http://localhost:3000"
```

**⚠️ Important**: Without `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, authentication will fail with "Missing environment variable" errors.

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Technical Risks
**Novel.sh Complexity:** Custom block development may be more complex than expected
- *Mitigation:* Start with simple text blocks, add interactivity incrementally
- *Contingency:* Fall back to simpler editor with separate task management

**Convex Scaling:** Real-time collaboration may hit performance limits
- *Mitigation:* Test with multiple concurrent users early
- *Contingency:* Implement selective real-time updates or polling fallback

**Mobile Performance:** Complex document blocks may not work well on mobile
- *Mitigation:* Design mobile-first, test on real devices frequently
- *Contingency:* Simplified mobile UI with full features on desktop only

### Development Risks
**Feature Scope Creep:** Temptation to add features beyond Phase 1 scope
- *Mitigation:* Strict adherence to Phase 1 feature list
- *Contingency:* Move additional features to Phase 2 backlog

**Authentication Complexity:** Role-based permissions may become overly complex
- *Mitigation:* Start with simple roles, add granularity incrementally
- *Contingency:* Simplify initial role model, enhance in Phase 2

## Development Guidelines

### Foundation-First Approach
**Start with Features 1-5 before moving to any complex features. This ensures:**
- Authentication and permissions work correctly
- Role-based content display works correctly
- Dashboard foundation is solid
- All core infrastructure is validated

### Development Cleanup Protocol
**Before moving to production or major feature releases, ensure:**
- Remove all development testing components (RoleSwitcher, CounterTest)
- Clean up testing-related styling and components
- Remove development-only features and utilities
- Ensure no testing code remains in production builds
- Update documentation to reflect production state

### Phase 1 vs Phase 2
**Phase 1:** Focus on project management core (Features 1-16)
- All projects are `project_brief` document type
- Single navigation structure
- Core functionality fully operational

**Phase 2:** Document type system and mode switching (Features 17-18)
- Multiple document types and templates
- Mode switcher between Projects and Documentation
- Advanced cross-document features

### Testing Strategy
- Test role-based permissions thoroughly for each feature
- Use real-time collaboration testing with multiple browser instances  
- Test mobile responsiveness throughout development
- Implement E2E tests for critical user flows

### Performance Considerations
- Progressive loading for large documents
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Real-time update optimization
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Security Priorities
- Role-based access control at API level
- Data isolation between clients
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure authentication implementation

### Enhancement 3.1: Auth Flow Optimization - Convert Root to Sign-In ✅
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Assigned To:** Current Developer
**Progress:** 100% complete
**Priority:** Medium (UX Improvement)

**Goal:** Restructure routing so root page (/) becomes sign-in page for subdomain app, eliminating unnecessary marketing content and creating cleaner user flow.

**User Story:** As a user accessing the subdomain app, I want to immediately see the sign-in form at the root URL so that I can quickly access the platform without navigating through marketing content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Root page (/) displays sign-in form instead of marketing content
- [x] Successful sign-in redirects to '/dashboard' 
- [x] Authenticated users accessing '/' are redirected to '/dashboard'
- [x] Unauthenticated users accessing protected routes are redirected to '/'
- [x] Sign-up page moved to '/sign-up' (outside auth group)
- [x] Dashboard landing page created at '/dashboard'
- [x] All internal links updated to reflect new structure
- [x] Middleware logic updated for proper routing protection
- [x] All authentication flows work with new structure

**Technical Tasks:**
- [x] Replace src/app/page.tsx content with sign-in form
- [x] Create src/app/dashboard/page.tsx as authenticated landing page
- [x] Update SignInForm redirect logic to go to '/dashboard'
- [x] Enhance middleware with authentication-based routing
- [x] Move sign-up to src/app/sign-up/page.tsx
- [x] Move sign-out to src/app/sign-out/page.tsx
- [x] Remove (auth) route group (no longer needed)
- [x] Update all navigation links and internal references
- [x] Test complete authentication and routing flow

**Benefits:**
- Cleaner UX for subdomain app (no marketing clutter)
- Faster access to platform functionality
- More logical URL structure
- Better alignment with document-centric PM platform vision
- Simplified routing and navigation

**Files Modified:**
- **src/app/page.tsx**: Replaced marketing content with SignInForm and auth redirect logic
- **src/app/dashboard/page.tsx**: Created authenticated landing page with dashboard UI
- **src/components/auth/SignInForm.tsx**: Added redirect to /dashboard after sign-in
- **src/components/auth/SignUpForm.tsx**: Updated sign-in link and added redirect to /dashboard
- **src/middleware.ts**: Enhanced with authentication-based routing logic
- **src/app/sign-up/page.tsx**: Moved from (auth) group to root level
- **src/app/sign-out/page.tsx**: Moved from (auth) group to root level

**Testing Status:** ✅ All authentication flows tested and working correctly
**Note:** Bug #004 (Duplicate Route Conflict) was resolved during implementation by properly removing the old (auth) route group.
