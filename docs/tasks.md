## ✅ Completed: Feature 17.2.4 – Sprints Section Deep Dive

Acceptance focus for this phase:
- Capacity in HOURS (workstreams × org default 32h) and locked at creation
- Task size selection in DAYS with mapping (XS=0.5d/4h, S=2d/16h, M=4d/32h, L=6d/48h, XL=8d/64h); backend accepts `estimatedHours`
- Department backlog across ALL projects (not gated by project status)
- Sprint timeline visualization and hour-based metrics
- Full‑page sprint create/edit experience to handle large backlogs

Delivered:
- [x] Backend: Hour-based capacity calculation using `organizations.defaultWorkstreamCapacity`
- [x] Backend: `getSprintStats` hour metrics (capacity/committed/utilization, velocity)
- [x] Backend: Department backlog `getDepartmentBacklog` across all department projects
- [x] Backend: `getSprintsWithDetails` for table metrics and timeline
- [x] Frontend: Stats cards, filters, table+timeline
- [x] Frontend: Sprint create/edit as full page (`/sprints/new`, `/sprints/[id]/edit`) with DnD backlog
- [x] Business‑week target end date computed from start date and duration (weeks)
- [x] Assignee dropdown shows all internal users + client users assigned to department
- [x] Project tasks UI updated with days dropdown and size shown in table
- [x] Sprints index now routes to full‑page create/edit; modal removed for create

Remaining polish (tracked for later):
- [ ] Virtualized backlog and multi‑select assign
- [ ] Sprint board reorder and capacity view


### Strategic Rationale for Reordering:
- Admin Config sections establish foundational client/department/user relationships
- Projects and Sprints depend on properly configured clients and departments
- Aligns with optimal demo flow (start with client setup)
- Schema validation happens early before complex operational views

## 🚀 Major Features (Post-Admin Config)

### Feature 18: Live Document Collaboration
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 16-20 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature 17.3 (JIRA-Style Slug Identifiers)  
**Goal:** Implement real-time collaborative editing in documents with live user presence, cursor tracking, and conflict-free collaborative editing using BlockNote + Convex.

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate in real-time on documents so that I can see who else is editing, see their cursors, and have our changes automatically synchronized without conflicts or data loss.

#### Core Features:
**Real-time Presence System**:
- Live user avatars in document top bar showing active editors
- Real-time cursor position tracking and display
- User status indicators (typing, idle, away)
- Entry/exit notifications for document sessions

**Collaborative Editing Engine**:
- Leverage BlockNote's built-in collaboration features
- Conflict-free collaborative editing with operational transforms
- Real-time document synchronization via Convex subscriptions
- Auto-save with merge conflict resolution
- Version history and change tracking

**User Experience**:
- Smooth cursor animations and user identification
- Live typing indicators
- Collaborative block selection and editing
- Document lock prevention (multiple users can edit simultaneously)

#### Implementation Architecture:
1. **Backend Schema Updates**: Add `documentSessions` table for tracking active editing sessions
2. **Real-time Presence**: WebSocket-like presence system using Convex subscriptions
3. **Cursor Tracking**: Store and broadcast cursor positions with user context
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Implement BlockNote's collaboration provider with Convex
5. **Session Management**: Track document entry/exit, idle detection, cleanup

#### Technical Considerations:
- Use Convex's real-time subscriptions for presence and document changes
- Implement BlockNote's collaboration protocol with Convex backend
- Efficient cursor position updates (throttled, only when changed)
- Memory management for large documents with many collaborators
- Graceful degradation when collaboration features fail

#### Implementation Phases:
1. **Phase 1**: Set up document sessions and basic presence tracking
2. **Phase 2**: Implement BlockNote collaboration provider with Convex backend
3. **Phase 3**: Add cursor tracking and visual indicators with smooth animations
4. **Phase 4**: Polish UX with typing indicators, entry/exit notifications, and status management

### Feature 19: Universal Attachment System  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature 18 (Live Document Collaboration)  
**Goal:** Implement a comprehensive attachment system that supports media, documents, and files across all entities (projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments) with library aggregation capabilities.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to attach images, documents, and files to any content (projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments) so that I can provide visual context, reference materials, and supporting documentation. As a team lead, I want to view all attachments in a library view so that I can manage project assets centrally.

#### Core Architecture (Following Existing Patterns)
**Polymorphic Attachment Model** (Following comments.ts pattern):
- Single `attachments` table with polymorphic relationships
- Supports: projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments
- Future-proof for new entities
- Client/department scoping for permissions
- Library aggregation via `isPublic` flag

#### Implementation Components
1. **File Upload System**: Drag-and-drop upload zones for all supported entities
2. **Attachment Display Components**: Image preview, document icons, library grid view
3. **Polymorphic Query System**: Dynamic queries based on entity type
4. **Upload & Management Mutations**: Complete CRUD operations for attachments

### Feature 20: Enhanced Document Comments: Live Team Collaboration Feature
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 20-24 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature 19 (Universal Attachment System)  
**Goal:** Transform the existing document commenting system from isolated annotations into a live, conversational message thread that encourages team collaboration and enables actionable feedback through AI analysis.

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to collaborate through live message threads within documents so that I can have natural conversations, track feedback, and automatically extract actionable tasks from our discussions.

#### Core Concept:
- Keep existing Convex comment infrastructure - this is a UI/UX transformation, not a rebuild
- Present comments as live message thread - chronological flow with threading capabilities
- Maintain document anchoring - comments can still reference specific elements/sections
- Enable AI-assisted task extraction - analyze conversations for actionable items

### Feature 21: Client Access & Permissions
**Priority:** Low  
**Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature 20 (Enhanced Document Comments)  
**Goal:** Provide clients with appropriate access to their project documents

**User Story:** As a client, I want to view my project documents and provide feedback so that I can stay informed and collaborate effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clients can only access their own client's data
- Department switching works for multi-department clients
- Block-level permissions filter content appropriately
- Client interactions are properly limited

### Feature 22: Search & Polish
**Priority:** Low  
**Estimated Time:** 14-18 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature 21 (Client Access & Permissions)  
**Goal:** Add search functionality and polish the overall experience
