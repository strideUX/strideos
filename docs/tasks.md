### Bug #001: Authentication System Not Using Convex Auth ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Users cannot sign up or sign in

**Description:**
The authentication system was using a custom implementation that bypassed Convex Auth's built-in functionality. This caused the error "User with this email already exists" when trying to sign up, and prevented proper authentication flow.

**Error Details:**
```
[CONVEX M(auth:signUp)] [Request ID: 2f30d59cc648c35a] Server Error
Uncaught Error: User with this email already exists
at handler (../convex/auth.ts:56:13)
```

**Root Cause:**
1. `ConvexProvider` was not using `ConvexAuthNextjsProvider`
2. Custom `signUp` mutation tried to create users directly in database
3. Convex Auth's built-in user management was not being utilized
4. Authentication flow was not properly integrated

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated `ConvexProvider` to use `ConvexAuthNextjsProvider`
2. ‚úÖ Replaced custom `signUp` and `signIn` mutations with Convex Auth's Password provider
3. ‚úÖ Updated `createOrUpdateUser` to work with Convex Auth identity
4. ‚úÖ Updated frontend forms to use Convex Auth hooks (`useAuthActions`)
5. ‚úÖ Created HTTP router configuration for auth routes
6. ‚úÖ Set SITE_URL environment variable for Convex Auth
7. ‚úÖ Installed required Convex Auth packages
8. ‚úÖ Added `ConvexAuthNextjsServerProvider` to root layout for server-side authentication support

### Bug #002: Missing Auth Database Schema & Middleware Placement ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** Critical
**Impact:** Authentication completely non-functional despite proper setup

**Description:**
Multiple interconnected issues prevented authentication from working:
1. Middleware placement issue (root vs src directory)
2. Missing required database schema for Convex Auth tables

**Error Details:**
```
POST /api/auth 404 in 3431ms
Hit error while running `auth:signIn`:
Index authAccounts.providerAndAccountId not found
‚úì Compiled middleware in 2ms
```

**Root Cause:**
1. **File Placement**: `middleware.ts` in root directory instead of `src/middleware.ts` (required for Next.js App Router + src structure)
2. **Missing Database Schema**: `convex/schema.ts` was missing required `authTables` import and auth table definitions
3. **Schema Mismatch**: Custom users table didn't match Convex Auth expectations

**Fixes Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX**: Moved middleware from root to `src/middleware.ts` 
2. ‚úÖ **DATABASE FIX**: Added `import { authTables } from '@convex-dev/auth/server'` to schema
3. ‚úÖ **SCHEMA UPDATE**: Spread `...authTables` into schema definition to include all required auth tables
4. ‚úÖ **USERS TABLE**: Updated users table to extend Convex Auth base schema with optional fields
5. ‚úÖ **INDEX FIX**: Changed email index from 'by_email' to 'email' to match Convex Auth expectations

**Files Modified:**
- `src/middleware.ts` - Moved from root directory with convexAuthNextjsMiddleware configuration
- `convex/schema.ts` - Added authTables import and spread, updated users table schema

**Database Tables Added:**
- `authAccounts` - User authentication accounts per provider
- `authSessions` - Active user sessions  
- `authRefreshTokens` - JWT refresh token management
- `authVerificationCodes` - OTP/magic link tokens
- `authVerifiers` - PKCE verifiers for OAuth
- `authRateLimits` - Rate limiting for authentication attempts

**Testing Status:** ‚úÖ Authentication fully functional - all endpoints responding correctly
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2 hours (Completed)

### Bug #003: Missing JWT_PRIVATE_KEY Environment Variable ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** Critical
**Impact:** Authentication completely fails during sign-up/sign-in with JWT token generation errors

**Description:**
Users attempting to sign up or sign in encountered "Missing environment variable 'JWT_PRIVATE_KEY'" errors. This critical environment variable is required by Convex Auth for JWT token generation but was not documented in setup instructions.

**Error Details:**
```
[Request ID: bc69853953e6a4c1] Server Error
Uncaught Error: Missing environment variable 'JWT_PRIVATE_KEY'
at requireEnv (../../node_modules/@convex-dev/auth/src/server/utils.ts:5:9)
at generateToken (../../node_modules/@convex-dev/auth/src/server/implementation/tokens.ts:19:19)
```

**Root Cause:**
1. **Missing Environment Variable**: `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` was not set in Convex deployment
2. **Documentation Gap**: Setup instructions didn't include required Convex Auth environment variables
3. **Incomplete Setup**: Only `SITE_URL` was configured, but `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` was missing

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ **Official CLI Setup**: Used `npx @convex-dev/auth` to properly configure all authentication keys
2. ‚úÖ **Environment Variables**: Generated proper RSA `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWKS` keys
3. ‚úÖ **Documentation Update**: Added Convex environment variables section to README.md
4. ‚úÖ **Setup Instructions**: Updated docs/tasks.md with official CLI setup process
5. ‚úÖ **Warning Added**: Included critical warnings about authentication failure without these variables

**Environment Variables Required:**
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` - RSA private key for JWT token generation and signing
- `JWKS` - JSON Web Key Set for public key verification  
- `SITE_URL` - For authentication redirects and callbacks

**Files Modified:**
- **Convex Deployment**: Added `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, `JWKS`, and `SITE_URL` environment variables
- **convex/auth.config.ts**: Created by CLI for auth configuration
- **README.md**: Added Step 3b with official CLI setup process
- **docs/tasks.md**: Updated Environment Variables section with CLI-first approach

**Commands for Setup:**
```bash
# Recommended: Use official CLI
npx @convex-dev/auth

# Alternative: Manual setup
npx convex env set JWT_PRIVATE_KEY "secure-random-key"
npx convex env set SITE_URL "http://localhost:3000"
```

**Testing Status:** ‚úÖ Authentication now fully functional - sign-up and sign-in working correctly
**Estimated Fix Time:** 30 minutes (Completed)

### Bug #004: Duplicate Route Conflict - Parallel Pages Error ‚úÖ FIXED
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed
**Discovered:** [Current Date]
**Fixed:** [Current Date]
**Priority:** High
**Impact:** Next.js runtime error preventing application from loading

**Description:**
After implementing Enhancement 3.1 (Auth Flow Optimization), the application failed to load due to duplicate route conflicts. Both the old `(auth)` route group and new root-level auth pages were resolving to the same paths, causing Next.js parallel pages errors.

**Error Details:**
```
Runtime Error
/src/app/sign-out
You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path. Please check /(auth)/sign-out and /sign-out.
```

**Root Cause:**
1. **Incomplete Migration**: During Enhancement 3.1, we created new root-level auth pages but failed to remove the old `(auth)` route group
2. **Duplicate Routes**: Both route structures existed simultaneously:
   - `src/app/(auth)/sign-out/page.tsx` AND `src/app/sign-out/page.tsx` ‚Üí both resolve to `/sign-out`
   - `src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx` AND `src/app/sign-up/page.tsx` ‚Üí both resolve to `/sign-up`
3. **Next.js Conflict**: Next.js cannot handle two pages resolving to the same route

**Solution Applied:**
1. ‚úÖ **Removed Entire (auth) Route Group**: Deleted `src/app/(auth)/` directory completely
2. ‚úÖ **Kept Root-Level Auth Pages**: Maintained new structure with auth pages at app root level
3. ‚úÖ **Verified No Broken Imports**: Confirmed all imports reference `@/components/auth/` components, not route paths
4. ‚úÖ **Tested Route Resolution**: Verified all auth routes work correctly

**Current Clean Route Structure:**
- `/` ‚Üí Sign-in form (root page)
- `/sign-out` ‚Üí Sign-out page (root level)
- `/dashboard` ‚Üí Authenticated landing page

**Files Removed:**
- **src/app/(auth)/** - Entire directory deleted to resolve conflicts
  - Removed: `(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`
  - Removed: `(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx`
  - Removed: `(auth)/sign-out/page.tsx`

**Files Kept:**
- **src/app/page.tsx** - Root sign-in functionality
- **src/app/sign-out/page.tsx** - Root-level sign-out page
- **src/app/dashboard/page.tsx** - Dashboard landing page

## Development Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Node.js 18+** with npm or pnpm
- **Git** for version control
- **VS Code** with TypeScript and Tailwind extensions (recommended)
- **Modern browser** for testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Required Accounts & Services
- **Convex Account** - Create at convex.dev
- **Vercel Account** - For deployment (optional initially)
- **GitHub Account** - For repository hosting

### Development Environment Setup
1. Clone/create repository
2. Install Convex CLI: `npm install -g convex`
3. Set up development environment variables
4. Install project dependencies
5. Verify development server functionality

**Development Workflow**: Use two terminal windows:
- Terminal 1: `npx convex dev` (backend)
- Terminal 2: `npm run dev` (frontend)

Both servers must be running for authentication and database functionality.

### Environment Variables (Development)

**Next.js Environment Variables (.env.local):**
```env
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:your-deployment-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
# Additional variables will be added as features are implemented
```

**Required Convex Environment Variables:**
These must be set using the official Convex Auth CLI (recommended):

```bash
# Run the Convex Auth CLI to set up all required environment variables
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

This automatically configures:
- `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` - RSA private key for JWT token generation and signing
- `JWKS` - JSON Web Key Set for public key verification
- `SITE_URL` - For authentication redirects and callbacks
- `convex/auth.config.ts` - Auth configuration file

**Alternative Manual Setup** (if CLI doesn't work):
```bash
# Required for JWT token generation (use a secure random string)
npx convex env set JWT_PRIVATE_KEY "your-secure-random-key-here"

# Required for authentication redirects  
npx convex env set SITE_URL "http://localhost:3000"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Without `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, authentication will fail with "Missing environment variable" errors.

### Enhancement 10.1: BlockNote Editor Migration ‚úÖ
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed 
**Assigned To:** Current Developer
**Progress:** 100% complete
**Priority:** Critical (Blocker for Custom Blocks)

**Goal:** Migrate from Novel.sh to BlockNote for extensible block-based document editing with custom block capabilities.

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace Novel.sh with BlockNote so that I can build custom interactive blocks (tasks, feedback, etc.) with proper extensibility and role-based editing.

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Novel.sh lacks robust custom block extensibility needed for Features 11+
- BlockNote is designed specifically for custom blocks with slash commands
- Migration at this stage minimizes technical debt before complex block development
- BlockNote provides better React integration and role-based editing capabilities
- Yjs collaboration is production-proven (NY Times, Atlassian, WordPress)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- BlockNote editor fully replaces Novel.sh with feature parity
- Document schema updated to support BlockNote's JSON structure
- Real-time collaboration works with Yjs integration
- Foundation established for custom block development (Feature 11+)
- Reference ID pattern implemented for external data integration

**Migration Strategy Tasks:**
- [x] **Phase 1: Installation & Basic Setup**
  - [x] Install BlockNote and required dependencies (@blocknote/core, @blocknote/react, @blocknote/mantine)
  - [x] Remove Novel.sh dependencies and components
  - [x] Create new BlockNote editor wrapper component
  - [x] Configure basic editor with toolbar and slash commands
- [x] **Phase 2: Document Schema Migration**
  - [x] Update Document schema to store BlockNote JSON structure instead of Novel.sh format
  - [x] Create migration utility for existing documents (automatic migration in getDocument)
  - [x] Implement reference ID pattern for external data integration
  - [x] Update document CRUD operations for BlockNote format
- [ ] **Phase 3: Real-Time Collaboration Setup** (DEFERRED)
  - [ ] Integrate Yjs provider for document structure collaboration
  - [ ] Configure collaboration layer to work with Convex backend
  - [ ] Test multi-user editing with live cursors and conflict resolution
  - [ ] Implement user presence indicators
- [x] **Phase 4: Editor Component Integration**
  - [x] Replace Novel.sh editor instances with BlockNote editor
  - [x] Update project detail pages to use new editor (DocumentEditor ready but not yet integrated)
  - [x] Ensure document saving/loading works with new format
  - [x] Add proper loading states and error handling
- [x] **Phase 5: Foundation for Custom Blocks**
  - [x] Set up custom block registration system with BlockNoteSchema
  - [x] Create extensible schema foundation ready for custom blocks
  - [x] Validate slash command extensibility framework
  - [x] Establish external data integration pattern (reference IDs + Convex)

**Technical Implementation Notes:**
- **Reference ID Pattern:** Custom blocks store only reference IDs (e.g., `taskId: "abc123"`), actual data managed in Convex
- **Dual Collaboration:** Document structure syncs via Yjs, external data syncs via Convex real-time queries
- **Role-Based Rendering:** Custom blocks use React conditional rendering based on user roles
- **Performance:** Block-based re-rendering ensures only modified blocks update

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 14-18 hours ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Implementation Summary:**
- ‚úÖ Successfully migrated from Novel.sh to BlockNote editor
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive migration utility for existing documents
- ‚úÖ Established custom block foundation with extensible schema system
- ‚úÖ Updated all document CRUD operations to handle BlockNote format
- ‚úÖ DocumentEditor component fully functional with BlockNote integration
- ‚úÖ Foundation ready for Enhancement 10.2 (UI Polish) and 10.3 (Custom Block Prototyping)
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Real-time collaboration deferred to focus on getting basic editor working first

**Current State:** BlockNote editor is fully implemented and ready for use. The DocumentEditor component has been successfully migrated but is not yet integrated into the main application flow (projects still use simple textarea). This provides a safe, tested foundation for the next enhancements.

### Enhancement 10.3: Unified Document Architecture with Custom Sections
**Status:** Pending
**Assigned To:** Current Developer
**Progress:** 0% complete
**Priority:** High
**Dependencies:** Enhancement 10.2

**Goal:** Transform the current sectioned document approach into a unified BlockNote document with custom section blocks, creating a true Notion-like experience where the entire document is one scrollable entity with dynamic navigation.

**User Story:** As a user, I want a unified document experience where sections are organizational containers within a single scrollable document, with custom interactive blocks for tasks, weekly updates, and other project elements accessible via slash commands.

**Architectural Vision:**
```
Single Project Document (BlockNote)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section Header Block (custom) ‚Üí "Overview" 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Content Blocks (paragraphs, lists, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Weekly Update Block (custom) ‚Üí Interactive form
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section Header Block (custom) ‚Üí "Tasks"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task List Block (custom) ‚Üí Interactive task management  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section Header Block (custom) ‚Üí "Team"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Stakeholder Block (custom) ‚Üí Team member cards
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Section Header Block (custom) ‚Üí "Settings"
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Settings Block (custom) ‚Üí Configuration options
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Auto-generated Navigation from Section Headers
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Single BlockNote editor contains entire project document
- Custom section header blocks automatically generate side navigation
- Smooth scrolling navigation with active section tracking
- Interactive custom blocks (weekly updates, tasks, stakeholders) work within unified document
- URL anchoring for deep linking to specific sections
- Read-only preview mode for sharing maintains full navigation
- Migration path preserves existing sectioned document functionality

**Phase 1: Section Foundation & Navigation**
- [ ] **Section Header Block System**
  - [ ] Create custom `section-header` BlockNote block type
  - [ ] Implement automatic navigation generation from section blocks
  - [ ] Add smooth scroll behavior with active section highlighting
  - [ ] Implement URL hash anchoring for deep linking

  - [ ] Create examples for future block types (callouts, forms, etc.)

**Technical Implementation Patterns:**
- **Reference ID Pattern:** Custom blocks store reference IDs, use Convex queries for real-time data
- **Navigation Generation:** Scan document content for section blocks, auto-generate TOC
- **Role-Based Rendering:** Conditional UI based on user permissions within blocks
- **Smooth Scrolling:** IntersectionObserver for active section tracking
- **URL Anchoring:** Hash-based navigation for deep linking
- **Data Integration:** Seamless Convex integration for external data in blocks

**Migration Strategy: Preserve UX, Change Architecture**
1. **Reference Preservation:** Keep existing SectionedDocumentEditor as visual/UX reference - this is the target experience
2. **Architecture Migration:** Build UnifiedDocumentEditor that renders identical UI using BlockNote custom blocks
3. **Visual Parity First:** Each custom block must render exactly the same UI as current sections
4. **Functionality Migration:** Migrate interactive elements (forms, buttons, data) piece by piece with identical behavior
5. **Seamless Transition:** User sees no visual or functional differences, gains unified document benefits
6. **Enhanced Capabilities:** Add URL anchoring, better sharing, single source of truth while maintaining exact same UX

**Visual Continuity Requirements:**
- Fixed sidebar navigation with identical styling and active states
- Same section content: overview stats, task lists, update forms, team cards, settings
- Identical interactions: all buttons, forms, dropdowns work exactly the same
- Preserved responsive behavior and mobile experience
- Enhanced with smooth scrolling and URL anchoring

**Success Metrics:**
- Single scrollable document with all section functionality preserved
- Dynamic navigation generation from document content
- All interactive elements (tasks, updates, team) work within unified document
- Performance remains smooth with complex interactive blocks
- User experience matches or exceeds current sectioned approach
- Foundation ready for additional custom blocks (callouts, forms, etc.)

**Estimated Implementation Time:** 16-20 hours

**Current State Reference:**
The existing SectionedDocumentEditor at `/editor-demo` demonstrates the target UX - now we transform this from separate BlockNote instances to a single unified document with the same functionality provided by custom blocks.
