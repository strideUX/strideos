## âœ… Completed: Feature 17.2.4 â€“ Sprints Section Deep Dive

Acceptance focus for this phase:
- Capacity in HOURS (workstreams Ã— org default 32h) and locked at creation
- Task size selection in DAYS with mapping (XS=0.5d/4h, S=2d/16h, M=4d/32h, L=6d/48h, XL=8d/64h); backend accepts `estimatedHours`
- Department backlog across ALL projects (not gated by project status)
- Sprint timeline visualization and hour-based metrics
- Fullâ€‘page sprint create/edit experience to handle large backlogs

Delivered:
- [x] Backend: Hour-based capacity calculation using `organizations.defaultWorkstreamCapacity`
- [x] Backend: `getSprintStats` hour metrics (capacity/committed/utilization, velocity)
- [x] Backend: Department backlog `getDepartmentBacklog` across all department projects
- [x] Backend: `getSprintsWithDetails` for table metrics and timeline
- [x] Frontend: Stats cards, filters, table+timeline
- [x] Frontend: Sprint create/edit as full page (`/sprints/new`, `/sprints/[id]/edit`) with DnD backlog
- [x] Businessâ€‘week target end date computed from start date and duration (weeks)
- [x] Assignee dropdown shows all internal users + client users assigned to department
- [x] Project tasks UI updated with days dropdown and size shown in table
- [x] Sprints index now routes to fullâ€‘page create/edit; modal removed for create

Remaining polish (tracked for later):
- [ ] Virtualized backlog and multiâ€‘select assign
- [ ] Sprint board reorder and capacity view


### Strategic Rationale for Reordering:
- Admin Config sections establish foundational client/department/user relationships
- Projects and Sprints depend on properly configured clients and departments
- Aligns with optimal demo flow (start with client setup)
- Schema validation happens early before complex operational views

## ðŸš€ Major Features (Post-Admin Config)

### Feature 18: Universal Attachment System  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 12-16 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature 17.2 (Admin UX Complete) âœ… **COMPLETE ALL 17.X FIRST**  
**Goal:** Implement a comprehensive attachment system that supports media, documents, and files across all entities (projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments) with library aggregation capabilities.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to attach images, documents, and files to any content (projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments) so that I can provide visual context, reference materials, and supporting documentation. As a team lead, I want to view all attachments in a library view so that I can manage project assets centrally.

#### Core Architecture (Following Existing Patterns)
**Polymorphic Attachment Model** (Following comments.ts pattern):
- Single `attachments` table with polymorphic relationships
- Supports: projects, documents, sections, tasks, comments
- Future-proof for new entities
- Client/department scoping for permissions
- Library aggregation via `isPublic` flag

#### Implementation Components
1. **File Upload System**: Drag-and-drop upload zones for all supported entities
2. **Attachment Display Components**: Image preview, document icons, library grid view
3. **Polymorphic Query System**: Dynamic queries based on entity type
4. **Upload & Management Mutations**: Complete CRUD operations for attachments
