└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Data Flow Strategy
1. **Real-time Collaboration**: Y-sweet handles all live editing, cursor tracking, presence
2. **Document Metadata**: Convex stores document titles, permissions, user assignments
3. **Periodic Backup**: Y-sweet content synced to Convex every 30 seconds for backup
4. **User Context**: Convex provides user info to Y-sweet for presence/permissions
5. **Offline-First**: Y.js maintains local state, syncs when connection restored

---

## Multi-Section Document Architecture

### Section-Based Collaboration Strategy
Each document section gets an independent Y-sweet collaborative document:

```typescript
// Multiple independent collaborative sections
const DocumentEditor = ({ documentId, sections }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {sections.map(section => (
        <YDocProvider 
          key={section.id}
          docId={`doc-${documentId}-${section.id}`}
          authEndpoint="/api/y-sweet-auth"
        >
          <SectionEditor 
            sectionId={section.id}
            sectionType={section.type}
            user={currentUser}
          />
        </YDocProvider>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Multi-Section Benefits
- **Parallel Collaboration**: Users edit different sections simultaneously without conflicts
- **Independent Presence**: See who's editing which specific section
- **Better Performance**: Smaller collaborative documents per section
- **Granular Conflict Resolution**: Issues in one section don't affect others
- **Focused Collaboration**: Natural collaboration boundaries

## Network Resilience & Offline Support

### Y-sweet Network Advantages
**Problem Y-sweet Solves:** Traditional collaborative editors fail poorly with network issues.

### Specific Network Scenarios

#### 1. Complete Offline (WiFi drops)
**Y-sweet Behavior:**
- ✅ Editor continues working normally
- ✅ All changes stored in local Y.js document
- ✅ User sees "offline" indicator but can keep editing
- ✅ When reconnected, automatically syncs all changes

**Convex-Only Behavior:**
- ❌ Mutations fail with errors
- ❌ User must handle offline state manually
- ❌ Risk of losing unsaved work
- ❌ Poor user experience

#### 2. Intermittent Connection (Spotty WiFi)
**Y-sweet Behavior:**
- ✅ Buffers changes during connection drops
- ✅ Syncs seamlessly when connection stabilizes
- ✅ No user interruption
- ✅ Conflict-free merging of changes

**Convex-Only Behavior:**
- ❌ Failed mutations create inconsistent state
- ❌ Requires complex retry logic
- ❌ Potential race conditions

#### 3. Slow Network (High Latency)
**Y-sweet Behavior:**
- ✅ Immediate local updates (feels instant)
- ✅ Background sync doesn't block UI
- ✅ Optimistic collaboration

**Convex-Only Behavior:**
- ⚠️ Depends on optimistic updates implementation
- ⚠️ Can feel laggy on slow connections

- **Document Content**: BlockNote JSON content per section
- **Edit History**: Y.js maintains edit history automatically
- **User Presence**: Live cursor positions, user status

#### What Convex Stores
- **Document Metadata**: Title, created date, owner, permissions
- **User Management**: User profiles, roles, assignments
- **Project Context**: Document relationships, project associations
- **Backup Content**: Periodic snapshots of Y-sweet content (every 30 seconds)

#### Data Synchronization
```typescript
// Periodic backup sync (every 30 seconds)
useEffect(() => {
  const syncTimer = setInterval(async () => {
    const sections = yDoc.getMap('sections');
    const content = sections.toJSON();
    
    await saveToConvex({
      documentId,
      content,
      lastModified: Date.now(),
      source: 'y-sweet-sync'
    });
  }, 30000);
  
  return () => clearInterval(syncTimer);
}, [yDoc, documentId]);
```

### Migration Strategy
**From Current System**: 
1. Extract existing BlockNote content from Convex
2. Initialize Y-sweet documents with existing content
3. Enable hybrid sync going forward
4. Gradual migration document by document

**Benefits**:
- No data loss during migration
- Can rollback if needed
- Gradual deployment reduces risk

## User Experience Design

### Real-Time Collaboration Features
1. **Live Cursors**: See other users' cursor positions with names/colors
2. **User Presence**: Active user avatars in document header
3. **Typing Indicators**: Visual feedback when others are typing
4. **Connection Status**: Clear online/offline indicators
5. **Smooth Animations**: Professional cursor movement and presence updates

### Network Status Communication
```typescript
function ConnectionStatus({ status, isOnline }) {
  const messages = {
    connected: "Connected - changes sync in real-time",
    connecting: "Connecting - changes saved locally",
    disconnected: "Offline - changes will sync when reconnected"
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <StatusIcon status={status} />
      <span className="text-sm">{messages[status]}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Multi-Section User Experience
- **Section Headers**: Show active users per section
- **Independent Editing**: Edit different sections without conflicts
- **Section Navigation**: Smooth scrolling between collaborative sections
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for sync status per section

## Security & Permissions

### Authentication Integration
**Y-sweet Auth**: Integrate with existing Convex Auth system

```typescript
// Y-sweet auth endpoint integrates with Convex user context
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { docId } = await request.json();
  
  // Verify user has access to this document
  const user = await getCurrentUser();
  const hasAccess = await checkDocumentPermissions(user.id, docId);
  
  if (!hasAccess) {
    return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 403 });
  }
  
  // Generate Y-sweet token with user context
  const clientToken = await getOrCreateDocAndToken(connectionString, docId, {
    userId: user.id,
    userName: user.name,
    userColor: user.color || generateUserColor()
  });
  
  return Response.json({ clientToken });
}
```

### Permission Levels
1. **Document-Level**: Who can access/edit documents
2. **Section-Level**: Granular permissions per section type
3. **Role-Based**: Admin, PM, Task Owner, Client access levels
4. **Real-Time**: Permissions enforced at Y-sweet auth time
