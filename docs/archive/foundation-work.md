# Foundation & Completed Work Archive

## 2025-08 – Feature 22: User Account Management System
**Status:** Completed

**Overview:**
Adds a self-service account settings area for authenticated users with tabs for Profile, Security, and Preferences. Mirrors admin settings patterns and integrates with Convex Auth + storage.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Route: `src/app/(dashboard)/account/page.tsx`
- Components:
  - `src/components/account/AccountProfileTab.tsx`
  - `src/components/account/AccountSecurityTab.tsx`
  - `src/components/account/AccountPreferencesTab.tsx`
- Convex mutations (in `convex/users.ts`):
  - `updateUserProfile`
  - `uploadUserAvatar`
  - `generateAvatarUploadUrl`
  - `updateUserPassword` (token-based handoff to existing set-password flow)
- Navigation: avatar & link in `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx` and `src/components/nav-user.tsx`

**Security & Validation:**
- Auth required via `(dashboard)` layout `useAuth()`
- Server-side validation with `convex/values`
- File type/size checks on avatar upload; URL generated via Convex storage
- Password complexity enforced; token lifetime 15 minutes

**UX Notes:**
- Real-time toasts for success/error states
- Disabled states while processing
- Email is read-only (managed by auth)

**Dependencies:**
- Reuses existing invitation/password set flow in `convex/auth.ts`

## 2025-08 – Feature 17.2.4: Sprints Section Deep Dive
**Status:** Completed

**Overview:**
Delivers department‑scoped sprints with hour‑based capacity, full‑page planning UI, and cross‑project backlog selection. Replaces modal with dedicated routes and aligns task sizing to days (persisted as hours).

**Key Deliverables:**
- Backend
  - Hour‑based capacity and metrics (`convex/sprints.ts`)
  - Department backlog across all projects; size→hours mapping
  - `getSprintsWithDetails` for table metrics and timeline
- Frontend
  - Sprints page patterns + timeline (`SprintsTable`)
  - Full‑page create/edit: `src/app/(dashboard)/sprints/new/page.tsx`, `src/app/(dashboard)/sprints/[id]/edit/page.tsx`, shared `SprintFormPage`
  - Backlog DnD with capacity utilization; size shown in days
  - Project tasks UI with size (days) dropdown and table display

**Routing Changes:**
- Create: `/sprints/new`
- Edit: `/sprints/[id]/edit` (replaces modal)

**Notes:**
- Target end date auto‑computed from start date and duration using business weeks
- Assignee dropdown shows all internal users and department client users
