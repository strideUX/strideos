# Project Documentation System

## Overview
This project uses a doc-driven development approach with core documents as the source of truth:

### Active Development Docs:
1. **docs/specs.md** - Project specifications and requirements
2. **docs/architecture.md** - Technical architecture and implementation decisions  
3. **docs/design.md** - UI/UX design decisions and patterns
4. **docs/stack.md** - Technology stack guidelines and best practices
5. **docs/tasks.md** - **STREAMLINED** - Active development tasks only

### Archive Structure:
- **docs/archive/foundation-work.md** - All completed foundation and infrastructure work
- **docs/archive/original-tasks.md** - Complete historical task archive (pre-optimization)
- Future: **docs/archive/completed-features.md** - Individual feature archives as they're completed

## Documentation Check Protocol
Before starting any work, check if the `docs/` folder exists:

**If docs/ folder EXISTS:**
- Always reference these docs before coding
- Keep them updated as the project evolves
- **Check off completed tasks in real-time as work progresses**
- Follow the established patterns and decisions

**If docs/ folder DOES NOT EXIST:**
- Prompt user: "I notice there's no docs/ folder. Would you like me to:"
  - "A) Create the doc-driven structure now (recommended for structured development)"
  - "B) Proceed with vibe coding for now (we can add docs later)"
- If A: Create the full docs structure with templates
- If B: Code without docs but suggest adding them for larger features

## Core Principle
Always reference these docs when they exist. Keep them accurate and current with implementation reality.

## Implementation Standards
- **Reference latest docs via Context7** when starting new features or uncertain about patterns
- **Check external documentation** for Next.js, Convex, Novel.sh, shadcn/ui, TypeScript
- **Follow project docs first**, then latest external best practices
- **Maintain consistency** with established patterns in docs/stack.md

## Project Context
- Project: strideOS (document-centric project management)
- Stack: Next.js 15 + Convex + Novel.sh + shadcn/ui
- Focus: Real-time collaborative project documents with embedded PM functionality

## Getting Started
1. Check if docs/ exists and follow Documentation Check Protocol
2. If docs exist: Read docs/tasks.md for current priorities
3. Reference architecture.md, design.md, and stack.md as needed
4. Use "wrap session" command to end coding sessions cleanly
